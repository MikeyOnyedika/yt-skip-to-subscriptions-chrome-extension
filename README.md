# yt-skip-to-subscriptions-chrome-extension
Automatically performs a redirect to your subscription feed whenever you open youtube.com

## Motivation for the Project
Most times, I just want to see videos from channels that I subscribed to (stuffs that I actually care about) immediately I 
open youtube and not some stuff the YT Algorithm suggests me. That's the whole idea of this project. The project is not close to being finished, it just does the bare minimum (with alot of bugs).

## How to install this chrome extension (Running the project locally)
