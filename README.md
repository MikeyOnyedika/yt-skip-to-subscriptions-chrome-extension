# yt-skip-to-subscriptions-chrome-extension
## This extension makes sure that whenever you visit youtube.com, you are taken to the Subscription page and not the Home page.

## Motivation for the Project
I think the Home page can sometimes be a  distraction (for me atleast). I just want to see stuff that I subscribed to (stuffs that I actually care about) immediately I 
open youtube and not some stuff the YT Algorithm suggests me. The project is not close to being finished, it just does the bare minimum (with alot of bugs).

## How to install this chrome extension (Running the project locally)
- clone the repo by running  `git clone https://github.com/MikeyOnyedika/yt-skip-to-subscriptions-chrome-extension.git`
- open chrome browser
- go to `More Tools` > `Extensions` from the menu
- click the `Developer Mode` button to developer mode
- from the extra buttons that pop up, click the `load unpacked` button (this opens a file chooser dialog)
- from the file chooser dialog, navigate to where the cloned repo is and select the folder
- chrome will then install the extension. 
- In the settings for this extension i.e when you click `details` button on the extension card, make sure the `Automatically allow access on the following sites` is enabled
