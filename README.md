# yt-skip-to-subscriptions-chrome-extension
## This extension makes sure that whenever you visit youtube.com, you are taken to the Subscription page and not the Home page.

## Motivation for the Project
I think the Home page can be a  distraction. I just want to see stuff that I subscribed to immediately I 
open youtube and not some stuff the YT Algorithm suggests me.
